# HACK THE CODE

This repo consists of a code for logical as well as compute based hacking. Certain levels user need to cross in order to succeed and get through the game<br/>
Initially it was a private repo but now I have made it public so everyone can see the code so one can easily solve this by understanding the code<br/>

Anyhow one can get some idea of how to create something like this and add some efforts to create something on their own.

#### Just a basic lamp based server would be enough to run this application ####
